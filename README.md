To install an `.msu` update package using **wusa** (Windows Update Standalone Installer), follow these steps:

1. **Run the wusa Command**  
   Use the following syntax:
   ```
   wusa .msu [options]
   ```
   For example, to install an update silently and prevent automatic restart:
   ```
   wusa C:\Updates\Windows10-KB123456-x64.msu /quiet /norestart
   ```
   - Replace `C:\Updates\Windows10-KB123456-x64.msu` with the full path and filename of your `.msu` file.
   - `/quiet` runs the installer without user interaction.
   - `/norestart` prevents the system from restarting automatically after installation[2][3][5].

2. **Other Useful Options**
   - `/forcerestart` - Forces an immediate restart after installation.
   - `/warnrestart:` - Warns before restarting.
   - `/logfile:` - Saves installation logs to a specified file[5].

**Example Commands:**
- Install update interactively:
  ```
  wusa C:\Updates\Windows10-KB123456-x64.msu
  ```
- Install silently, no restart:
  ```
  wusa C:\Updates\Windows10-KB123456-x64.msu /quiet /norestart
  ```
- Install and log output:
  ```
  wusa C:\Updates\Windows10-KB123456-x64.msu /quiet /logfile:C:\update_log.txt
  ```
  To discover what is available for `Get-WinEvent`, you can list all event logs and providers on your system using its built-in parameters. Hereâ€™s how:

---

## List All Event Logs

To see all the logs you can query with `Get-WinEvent`, use:

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ListLog *
```
- This command lists every event log available on your system, including classic logs (like `System`, `Application`) and newer, application-specific or operational logs[1][3][5].

---

## List All Event Providers

To see all providers (sources of events), use:

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ListProvider *
```
- This lists all event providers, which are sources that write events to the logs. Providers often correspond to Windows components, drivers, or applications[1][3][5].

---

## List Events for a Specific Provider

To see what events a provider can generate (including Event IDs and descriptions):

```powershell
(Get-WinEvent -ListProvider "Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy").Events | Format-Table ID, Description -AutoSize
```
- Replace `"Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy"` with any provider name you found from the previous step[3].

### how to automate patching in windows and rhel with internet

Resource - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/patching-your-windows-ec2-instances-using-aws-systems-manager-patch-manager/

AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Patch Manager for Windows and RHEL critical patching, a weekly Maintenance Window, and email notifications via SNS and CloudWatch Events/EventBridge.

### Terraform Configuration Overview
1. **SNS Topic and Subscription**: For email notifications.
2. **CloudWatch Event Rule and Target**: To detect SSM patch failures and send details to SNS.
3. **SSM Patch Baselines**: For Windows and RHEL critical updates.
4. **SSM Maintenance Window**: For weekly patching.
5. **SSM Maintenance Window Task**: To execute the patching.
6. **IAM Role**: For EC2 instances to interact with SSM (assumed pre-existing for brevity).

### Terraform Code
Save this in a file like `main.tf`. Adjust variables (e.g., email address, timezone) as needed.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" # Adjust to your region
}

# Variables
variable "email_address" {
  description = "Email address for patch failure notifications"
  type        = string
  default     = "your.email@example.com" # Replace with your email
}

}
```

### Prerequisites and Notes
1. **IAM Role for EC2 Instances**:
   - This code assumes your EC2 instances already have an IAM role with the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy. If not, add this Terraform block:
     ```hcl
     resource "aws_iam_role" "ssm_role" {
       name = "SSMManagedInstanceRole"
       assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
         Version = "2012-10-17"
         Statement = [{
           Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
           Effect = "Allow"
           Principal = { Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com" }
         }]
       })
     }

     resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "ssm_policy" {
       role       = aws_iam_role.ssm_role.name
       policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore"
     }

     resource "aws_iam_instance_profile" "ssm_profile" {
       name = "SSMManagedInstanceProfile"
       role = aws_iam_role.ssm_role.name
     }
     ```
   - Attach this profile to your EC2 instances.

2. **Tagging Instances**:
   - The Maintenance Window targets instances tagged with `PatchGroup:Windows-Critical` or `PatchGroup:RHEL-Critical`. Tag your instances accordingly, or modify the `targets` block to use instance IDs or another method.

3. **S3 Bucket for Logs** (Optional):
   - If you want SSM command output logged to S3, create an S3 bucket and update the `output_s3_bucket_name` in the `aws_ssm_maintenance_window_task` resource.

4. **Email Confirmation**:
   - After applying this Terraform config, AWS SNS will send a confirmation email to the `email_address`. Accept it to activate the subscription.

5. **Apply the Configuration**:
   - Run:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     terraform plan
     terraform apply
     ```
   - Review the plan and confirm with `yes`.

### How It Works with Terraform
- **SNS and CloudWatch**: Provisions the notification system to email you when an SSM patch command fails, including instance ID, command ID, and failure details.
- **Patch Baselines**: Defines critical-only patch policies for Windows (aligned with Patch Tuesday) and RHEL.
- **Maintenance Window**: Automates weekly patching every Wednesday at 2:00 AM UTC, targeting tagged instances.
- **Idempotency**: Terraform ensures resources are created or updated consistently, avoiding manual drift.

### Customization
- **Region/Timezone**: Adjust `provider "aws"` region and `schedule` in the Maintenance Window to match your timezone.
- **Patch Groups**: Modify the `targets` in `aws_ssm_maintenance_window_target` to fit your instance tagging strategy.
- **More Granular Failure Details**: Enhance the CloudWatch Event `input_template` or integrate with CloudWatch Logs as needed.

This Terraform setup fully automates your patching and notification requirements. Let me know if youâ€™d like to tweak any part further!
